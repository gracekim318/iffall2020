            <header class="verse1"> [Verse 1] </header>
            <p>For all the times that you rained on my parade
            <br>And all the clubs you get in using my name
            <br>You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness' sake
            <br>You think I'm cryin' on my own. Well, I ain't</p>
            <header class="refrain"> [Refrain] </header>
            <p>And I didn't wanna write a song
            <br>'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't
            <br>But you still hit my phone up
            <br>And, baby, I'll be movin' on
            <br>And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
            <br>Maybe you should know that</p>
            <header class="pre-chorus"> [Pre-Chorus] </header>
            <p>My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            <br>And I never like to admit that I was wrong
            <br>And I've been so caught up in my job
            <br>Didn't see what's going on
            <br>But now I know
            <br>I'm better sleeping on my own</p>
            <header class="chorus"> [Chorus] </header>
            <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much
            <br>Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
            <br>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
            <br>You should go and love yourself</p>
            <header class="verse2"> [Verse 2] </header>
            <p>But when you told me that you hated my friends
            <br>The only problem was with you and not them
            <br>And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
            <br>And tried to make me forget where I came from</p>
            <header class="refrain"> [Refrain] </header>
            <p>And I didn't wanna write a song

            <p>For all the times that you made me feel small
            <br>I fell in love. Now I feel nothin' at all
            <br>I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
            <br>Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?</p>
